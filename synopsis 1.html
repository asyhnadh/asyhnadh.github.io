    <h2>Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone</h2>
<em><p>The story begins with an unassuming, yet peculiar event. In the quaint town of Privet Drive, Surrey, a young baby named Harry Potter 
    is left on the doorstep of the Dursley family, led by his unpleasant aunt 
    and uncle, Petunia and Vernon, and their spoiled son Dudley. 
    Unbeknownst to the Dursleys, Harry is no ordinary boy but a wizard, whose parents were killed by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort when he was 
    just an infant. Over the years, Harry’s life is marked by mistreatment and neglect, as the Dursleys hide his true identity from him, 
    keeping him ignorant of his magical heritage. However, as Harry approaches his eleventh birthday, mysterious letters start arriving for him, 
    and despite the Dursleys’ best efforts to prevent him from reading them, Harry learns that he is a wizard and has been accepted to attend 
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p></em>
