    <h2>Harry Potter and the goblet of fire</h2>
<em><p>In "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," 14-year-old Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year. He is unexpectedly chosen by the magical Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament, despite being underage. The tournament involves three dangerous tasks: facing a dragon, rescuing friends from the Black Lake, and navigating a deadly maze. During the final task, Harry and fellow competitor Cedric Diggory are transported to a graveyard where Voldemort returns to power and kills Cedric. Harry escapes and warns the wizarding world about Voldemort's return, but many refuse to believe him. The book concludes with Harry and his friends bracing for the challenges ahead as Voldemort's threat grows.</p></em>
