            <h2>J.K ROWLING</h2>
            <p> Joanne Rowling, known by her pen name J.K. Rowling, was born on July 31, 1965, in Yate, Gloucestershire, England. She grew up in Chepstow, Gwent, and attended Wyedean School and College. She later studied French and the Classics at the University of Exeter, where she spent a year studying in Paris.
                
                After graduating from university, Rowling worked in various jobs, including as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International. In 1990, while on a delayed train from Manchester to London, she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series. The following year, her mother passed away, which had a profound impact on her writing.
             
                Rowling moved to Portugal to teach English and married journalist Jorge Arantes in 1992. The couple had one child, Jessica, but divorced in 1993. Rowling then moved to Edinburgh, Scotland, with her daughter. Living on state benefits, she worked on her first book, often writing in cafes.
                
                In 1997, after being rejected by multiple publishers, Bloomsbury accepted "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" for publication. The book was a phenomenal success, leading to six sequels: "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (1998), "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" (1999), "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (2000), "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" (2003), "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" (2005), and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" (2007).
                The Harry Potter series became a global phenomenon, selling over 500 million copies and translated into over 80 languages. The books were adapted into a highly successful film series, with Rowling serving as a producer on the final films. Her work has inspired a generation of readers and has left a significant mark on popular culture.</p>
