    <h2>Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets</h2>
<em><p>"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," the second book in J.K. Rowling's series, follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

    Over the summer, Harry is warned by a house-elf named Dobby that danger awaits him at Hogwarts. Ignoring the warning, Harry returns to school, where students and other creatures are mysteriously petrified. Rumors spread about the Chamber of Secrets, said to house a monster controlled by the heir of Slytherin.
    
    Harry, with friends Ron and Hermione, investigates and discovers that the Chamber was opened fifty years ago. They learn that the monster is a Basilisk and that Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue makes him a suspect. Using clues from a magical diary, Harry finds the entrance to the Chamber, where he encounters a young version of Voldemort, Tom Riddle, who has been controlling Ginny Weasley.
    
    With help from Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, and a magical sword, Harry defeats the Basilisk and destroys the diary, vanquishing Riddle. The petrified students are revived, and Hogwarts returns to normal, celebrating Harry's bravery and the triumph of good over evil.</p></em>
